# MyALGLIB

This is a modification of ALGLIB Free Edition (C#) downloaded from:
 https://www.alglib.net/

ALGLIB is fast and accurate, and I hope to elevate the user experience (particularly me myself) of ALGLIB to another level by adding additional functionailities into the source files.
The methods I used may not be the smartest, so please give me feedbacks for improvement suggestions.

A brieif log of change is recorded in log.txt.
